cd car-go-sharing-app
```

### Step 2: Configure Database
If using Docker, you can run MySQL using the provided ```docker-compose.yml``` file:

```docker-compose up -d```

Make sure the database container is up and running.

Also, if you are using a local MySQL instance, make sure it matches the configuration specified in the file: ```application.properites```

- Create a database named books using your MySQL client:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE cargo;
```

### Step 3: Build the Project

Use Maven to build the application:
```
mvn clean install
```
### Step 4: Run the Application

Start the application using the following command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will be accessible at:

- __API:__ ```http://localhost:8080```
- __Swagger UI:__ ```http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html```

### Step 3: Test the Application

You can use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints.
Additionally, Swagger UI provides an interactive way to test all endpoints.
